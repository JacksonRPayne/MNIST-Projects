# MNIST-Projects
A collection of machine learning projects using my neural network library written in numpy and the MNIST database of handwritten digits

# Features
The neuralnetwork.py file provides 
1) A way to create a trainable feed forward neural network with any number of layers, each 
layer having any number of nodes.
2) A trainStochastically method which provides a gradient descent algorithm to train the network on
any input and output. 

The MNISTClassifier.py file provides
1) A neural network built with the neural network class that classifies images of handwritten MNIST digits.
2) A visual tool to see the network classifying digits from the testing set in real time.
